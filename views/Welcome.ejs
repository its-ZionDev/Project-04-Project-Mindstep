            <p>This novel series has been a labor of love, into which I’ve poured countless hours and effort. As a full-time student working part-time, crafting this narrative has brought me immense joy, and I’m excited to finally share it with you. If you’re reading this, I’m truly grateful that you’ve given my work a chance.</p>
            <p>This story has been a long time in the making, and I’m thrilled to see it come to life. Along the way, I’ve benefited from thoughtful feedback from fellow writers, stunning art from two talented artists, and a beautiful website built by a skilled designer. I feel incredibly fortunate to work with such wonderful collaborators, and I hope you, as the reader, will see not just my effort, but also the contributions of everyone who helped bring this project to life.</p>
